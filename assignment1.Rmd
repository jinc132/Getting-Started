### Math
This is the _pythorean theorem_ : \[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]
## Table of Values
data.table(Months = c("January","Febuary","March","April", "May", "December"),
          Year = c(2011, 2014, 2016, 2015, 2016, 2019))
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)

#Task 6
100/10+2

100/(10+2)

sqrt(140) * 40

log10(2^2 - 30)

log(982) - 3

#Task 7
p1 = 3 * 5
p2 = 3 / p1

log10(p1 + p2)

p1^p2

(p1 * 450) / (p2 / 30) ^(2/100)

# Task 8 
val = seq(1:30)
strings = c("Mary","had","a","little","lamb")
length(val)
length(strings)

sum(val)
#sum(strings)

# Task 9
num = seq(1:5)
hiVal = seq(6,10)
num + hiVal

vect3 = num * hiVal

# Task 10
combined = c(num,hiVal)
matrix = rbind(num,hiVal,vect3)
print(matrix)

df = data.frame(matrix)
print(df)
```
##Loading the Data
This is how to load data into R and how to convert it.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

file = read.table("China_EO_49to17.csv")
df = data.frame(file)
data = as_tibble(file)
```
